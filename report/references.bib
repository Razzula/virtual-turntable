% this piece predominantly discusses the manafacturing processes of vinyl; but could be useful to cite when discussing the convinience factor of digitalisation (some modern tracks are not designed with the physical medium in mind, and therefore may sound worse on such a format)

% "(1) The making of a copy of a work by a person who has lawful access to the work does not infringe copyright in the work provided that—

    the copy is made in order that a person who has lawful access to the work may carry out a computational analysis of anything recorded in the work for the sole purpose of research for a non-commercial purpose, and

% Section 28A
% Having a digital copy of an image counts as reproduction (whereas owning and reading a physical book, does not). Is it transient (only in RAM) or persistently stored? (section 28A outlines more leniency for temporary copies, which is why streaming services are allowed, for example.) Are whole images needed, or are we storing/using more data than is justified?
